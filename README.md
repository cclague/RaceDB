# Welcome to RaceDB

RaceDB is a database system for for Cross Manager. It allows registration of riders via web browser, and allows the timing person to refer to the race data in RaceDB from Cross Manager.

## Installation

There are two method to get RaceDB working
    - The hard way using lots of command line "code" as per the original install instructions (see Install-Readme.txt)
    - The easy way using Docker and the RaceDB-Container

If you are a seasoned RaceDB enthusist or a seasoned python programmer, feel free to run though the old install instructions. Otherwise, go install Docker (http://www.docker.com). Docker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows and Docker Community is available for Linux. Once Docker is installed, the installation procedure for all platforms is the same. By default, the Docker method uses MySQL for the database for best performance.
