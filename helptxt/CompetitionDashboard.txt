# Competition Dashboard

This is the primary interface for working with a Competition.  Every significant action to a competition is initiated from this screen.

## Participants
Participant records link the following information together:

* Competition
* License Holder
* Category
* Team
* Bib
* Tag and Tag2

The following combinations have a contraint to force the combination to be unique in the database:

* Competition, License Holder and Category
* Competition, Bib and Category
* Competition, Tag and Category
* Competition, Tag2 and Category

If this means nothing to you, don't worry - just know that these contraints make it:

* Impossible to enter the same competitor more than once in the same category
* Impossible to enter more than one competitor with the same bib number
* Impossible to enter to have more then one tag with the same value in the same category

However, it is possible to enter a Licence Holder more than once in the Competition.  This is done by entering the License Holder as a different Participant each time.
