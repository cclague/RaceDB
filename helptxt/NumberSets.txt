# Number Sets

__Number Sets__ allow you to track existing Bib numbers handed out to riders from Competition to Competition.
The __Number Set__ can be configured in the Competition edit screen.

For example, say you are running an MTB series and a Road series.
Let's pick a particular rider name Pat.

Pat rides in one category in MTB and a different category in Road.
Naturally, Pat has a number for each discipline used for each race for the entire season.  Say 117 for MTB and 207 for Road.

When Pat comes to a MTB race, we want to use the MTB bib number: 117.
And, when Pat comes to a Road race we want to use the Road bib number: 207.

This is accomplished by using a different __Number Set__ for each race type.

Define a __Number Set__ called "MTB Numbers" and another __Number Set__ called "Road Numbers".  Then, associate each __Number Set__ with each race in each series, respectively.

Now, RaceDB can correctly find the different Bib numbers.
