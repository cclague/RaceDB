# Competitions

In a nutshell, a Competition is a set of Mass Start events with some extra information.  A Mass Start event is a set of uniquely numbered riders on course at the same time, and can have a number of Start Waves within it.
Each Start Wave consists of one or more Categories starting together.

This is summarized as:

{% include "CompetitionStructure.md" %}

This is the fundamental structure of a competition.  Get comfortable with this structure, as it forms the foundation of everything else.

You describe this structure in RaceDB.  It then "knows" exactly where riders need to go when the check-in.

RaceDB has a powerful "Copy" feature that allows you to use the same race structure over again.  So, once you have your race formats defined, using them again for future races is quick.

# Competitions Screen

Shows a list of all Competitions in the system with the most recent shown first.  You can use the "Search text" feature to find a particular Competition.

Clicking on a Competition row triggers the default button (Dashboard).  This brings you to the main Competetion screen, the [Competition Dashboard][].

## Competition Copy
Makes a copy of the competition including all category information, Mass Start Events, Start Waves and Category numbers.  The Participants are not copied.

To create a new Competition from an existing one, press Copy, then change the fields in the new Competition to customize it (for example, Name, Date, Organizer).
