# License Holders

License Holders are usually competitors.  However, they can also be Team Staff, Organization Staff or Officials.

Most of the information about LicenseHolders is for reference only.

Of particular note is the __Eligible to Compete__ flag.
Normally this field is __True__.

Set it to __False__ if you there is a problem with the LicenseHolder that must be corrected before he/she can be allowed to compete.
This could include lack of payment or if you need to talk to the competitor about language or behavior.

There is also an __Ineligible Starting at__ field.  If set, the LicenseHolder will be considered ineligible __after__ this date/time.

__Ineligible Starting at__ defaults to the next day.  This makes it easy to the most common situation where you allow a rider to race today, but there is some issue
that must be taken care of before the rider can race again.  For example, the rider didn't bring his wallet and didn't pay.  Or, the rider didn't bring the proper ID, but must show it
before s/he can race at a later time.

You can enter a different __Ineligible Starting at__ date/time, or if you leave it blank, the rider will be considered ineligible immediately.

Always enter a reason in the __Note__ field if the LicenseHolder is ineligible.

If ineligible, RaceDB will not allow the LicenseHolder to self-serve check-in, and alerts will show on the Partcipant screen.
The LicenseHolder can pre-reg and be seeded in Time Trails.
