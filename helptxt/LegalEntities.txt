# Legal Entities

Legal Entities are the organizations that provide race insurance and require signed waivers from riders.

In addition to contact information, Legal Entities have a __Waiver Expiry Date__.

If you set a __Waiver Expiry Date__, rider's waivers that are signed before the __Waiver Expiry Date__ will be flagged as expired in the __Participant Form__ and an updated waiver can be managed by registration staff.

A Legal Entitity can ensure one or more [Competitions][], and of course, the organizer of record of the Competition can be different from the Legal Entity insuring it.
