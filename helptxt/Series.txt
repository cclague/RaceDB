# Series

Series allow you to compute a combined result from a number of races.

## Category Format

When creating a new Series, you must choose a Category Format.  Only Competitions with the same CategoryFormat can be added to the Series.
It is important to get this right.

## Ranking Criteria

A Series can be scored by 3 Ranking Criteria:

1. Points Structure
1. Time
1. Percent Winner / Finish time

A __Points Structure__ is a list of points-for-place in the finish.  A points structure can also specify points for finishing a race, points for DNF and points for DNS (see below).

Time ranks by the finish time.  A series scored by time is always first scored by events completed, then by the total time.  There is no score considered for DNF, DNS or lapped riders.

Percent Winner / Finish time is a points system computed as follows Points = Winner's Time / Athlete's Time * 100.  This means that the winner gets 100 points.  All other athletes are awarded pointed based on a ratio of the winner's time.

For example, say the Winner's time was 52 minutes, and another Athlete's time was 56 minutes.  The points awarded for this event would be:

    Points = 100.0 * 52 / 56 = 92.86

For this option, there are no DNF or DNS points.  There are also no points for lapped riders.

## Callup Max

Number of athletes to list in Callups.  If zero, this Series will not be used for Callups.
If non-zero, the first Series with non-zero Callup Max will be used for Callups.
A reasonable number might be 16 - the first two rows of a CycloCross Race start.

If you wish all athletes in each start Wave to be included in the Callups, set the __Callup Max__ to a large number, like 500.

Start Waves with Callups will be displayed with a __Callups__ button in the Competition Dashboard.

### Randomize if no Results

If a Rider has no results, he/she is not included in the callup by default.  This option includes riders up to __Callup Max__, but randomizes riders with no results.

## Points Structures

Specify the Points-for-place, Finisher, DNF and DNS points.  You can specify multiple structures and configure them by event.
The default Points-for-place is the first one.
