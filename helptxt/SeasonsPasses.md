# Season's Passes

__Season's Passes__ allow you to create a set of riders that hold a season's pass.

You then associate the __Season's Pass__ with the Competition with the __Season's Pass__ field.

When a rider is checked-in to a race, if he/she is a season's pass holder, the "Paid" flag will be automatically set to "True".
