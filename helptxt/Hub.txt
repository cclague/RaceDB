# Hub Mode

RaceDB supports a fully indexed results capability accessible by Competition and Athlete.

Hub mode is intended to be accessed by external users.  When in Hub mode, RaceDB is completely read-only and it is impossible to change data.

## Uploading Results from CrossMgr

Hub Mode displays results.  These must be uploaded from CrossMgr.

## Launching Hub Mode

Hub Mode can be lauched by adding the __--hub__ parameters to the launch command.  For example:

    python manage.py launch --hub

All other parameters work as usual, except rfid parameters are ignored.

This will start RaceDB in hub mode.  Attempts to access other parts of the system will be routed to the Hub search page.

## Searching by Competition and Athlete

Hub mode is pretty straight-forward.  Search by Competitions or Athletes.  Click on the links to explore the results.

## Showing Combined Results by Start Wave

Most of the time, riders in a Start Wave are ranked separately by Category.

But, sometimes all categories in a Wave should be ranked together (for example, a combined Women's Master's race).

If this is the case, set __Rank Categories Together__ in the Wave edit screen (accessible from the __Competition Dashboard__).
