## Showing Combined Results by Start Wave

Sometimes all riders in a Start Wave are ranked separately by Category.
Sometimes they should be ranked together.

Tell RaceDB what you want by setting __Rank Categories Together__ in the Wave.

If you wish the categories in the wave to be ranked individually, leave this unset.
