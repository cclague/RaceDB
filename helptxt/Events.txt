# Events

An event is a race within a competition.
Currently RaceDB supports __Mass Start__ and __Time Trial__ events.

Each event has one or more Start Waves.  In a Mass Stat event, a Start Wave corresponds to a (potentially multi-category) start.
In a Time Trial event, a Start Wave corresponds to a group of Categories that will be seeded together.

All riders in a Start Wave do the same distance or race for the same minutes.

## Apply Select by Default to Existing Participants

Use this option if you have made changes to __Optional Events__ and you want to apply those changes to existing Participants.

Examples:

1. If you make the Event optional when it wasn't previously, and you have existing participants, you will need to press this button to add them.
1. If you add some new Categories to an optional Event that were not there previously.  Again, press this button to add the existing participants.
1. If you change the Event's __Select by Default__ option, press this button to reapply it on existing participants.

Use with caution.  Choices previously made by a Participant will be overwritten by this feature.
