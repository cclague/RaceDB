# Category Formats

Category Formats are a collection of Categories that define a race format.

Categories define the scope of a rider ranking (for example, Men Elite).

Category Formats can be based on any standard or criteria including:

* UCI
* USAC Ability Based
* Local Ability Based
* Age Based
* Whatever you want!

RaceDB comes with the standard Category Formats to get started with.
Copy and edit one, or create a new one from scratch.

## Categories

Categories are the components of a Category Format.

Categories have a short _Code_, and _Gender_ (one of "Men", "Women" or "Open") and a long _Description_.
