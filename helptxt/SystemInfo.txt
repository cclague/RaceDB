## Tag Template

This specifies the template to use to automatically create RFID tags.

RaceDB can create RFID tags on-the-fly at race check-in.

It create guaranteed unique RFID tag values for competitors based on their "License Holder" internal database key: no rider can get the same RFID tag code.

However, it is important to add extra characters to the tags that are unique to your system.  This is to prevent "tag pollution" - competitors crossing the line with tags from other race timing systems that match tags codes in use in your race.

It may also be important to assign extra characters so you can distinguish tags from year to year (for example, if you are charging a series fee and want to re-issue unique tags each year).

The Tag Template addresses these problems.  It can be any sequence of hex characters (i.e. chars in "0123456789ABCDEF") with a sequence of "#" characters in it.  The "#" is where RaceDB writes its unique id number.

When RaceDB initializes, it creates a random 4-char hex prefix, followed by '######', followed by the current 2-digit year, for example "EDDE######14'.  With this template, RaceDB will create tags of the form:

* EDDE00001114
* EDDE00018714
* EDDE01200014
* EDDE09882014
* ...

That is, the '######' part is filled in with unique database id, and the other characters in the template are added.
Change the template to suit your purposes.  All new generated tags will the follow the template.

## Reg Closure Minutes

The number of minutes that registration is considered __closed__ before an event.
If __-1__, then registration is never considered closed.

Currently, this just shows a warning message on the __Participant Form__ showing the late registered __Start Waves__ - it does not physically stop the registration process.
